    <h2>About Apollo</h2>

    <p>80% of the data in the world is unstructured. Time and time again, we run against the human barriers to data extraction: poor motivation, wasted talent, and an overwhelming amount of information.</p>

    <p>Apollo uses state-of-the-art algorithms to extract information trapped in unstructured data. Using semantic role labeling and other techniques from cognitive linguistics, we intelligently link information and create a neural network of ideas and concepts from unstructured data. We envision a world where data is liberated regardless of context, and we believe Apollo will bridge that gap.</p>
