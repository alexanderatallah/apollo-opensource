    <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
    <p>
      Be nice. We are a community-run effort and open source project and do not have resources to deal with
      possible legal reprecussions of our users' actions. On the other hand, we are trying to be nice to you
      and other users as well, possibly being not so nice only when we have to protect some users or content
      from other users. If you have any concern with how Apollo operates and this terms of use, please
      <a href="mailto:hello@apollo.org">contact us</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apollo/apollo/issues/new">open a ticket</a> for public discussion, or
      <a href="https://github.com/wlanslovenija/django-tastypie-mongoengine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst">open a pull
      request</a> with a proposed change.
    </p>
    <h3>Public Data You Contribute</h3>
    <p>
      An important part of Apollo is collaboration on academic commons. We do not want your contributions
      to human knowledge to be locked away ever again by anybody, including us. To assure this, by
      participating and contributing you irrevocably license your contributions worldwide under
      the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> (public domain) license (version 1.0
      or newer), including releasing any patents therein. In other words, all public data you contribute is seen
      as a common good and dedicated to the public domain. Your contributions will be publicly available,
      including their history, for everyone to use. On the other hand, this means you can use everything contributed
      by others as well. Although under the CC0 license there is no legal requirement of attribution, do not forget
      that using works of others without properly citing sources can be seen as plagiarism.
    </p>

    <h3>Private Data You Store</h3>
    <p>
      Private data (private publications, private annotations, etc.) you store in Apollo stays yours and you
      retain full ownership, copyright, and other rights. We are just helping you store this data online, providing
      you with an easy and familiar way to access it from anywhere and read and work with publications.
      This is like working on your personal computer, just online and in the browser.
